# State vs PRops

## State

> internal data,owned by component
> component memory
> can be updated by the component itself
> updating state causes component to re-render
> used to make components interactive

## Props

> external data,owned by parent component
> similar to function parameters
> read-only
> Recieving new props causes component to re-render.Usually when the parent's state has been updated.
> used by parent to configure child component("settings")
